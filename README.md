# Rendu : this was my first semester project, which I've done at the Laboratory for Renweable Energy Science and Engineering (LRESE) at the EPFL.

The main goal consisted in modeling the rapid filling of a gaseous hydrogen tank and to control it in an optimal way so that filling duration is minimised while critical 
evolve in a secure manner. Those are essentially the pressure and the inner tank temperature.

As a first step, a complete mathematical model of the system was derived. It uses thermodynamics tables to ensure the accuracy of the results and has been compared to state-of-the art 
models found in the literature, as well as validated using measurements, which were also found within the literature.
